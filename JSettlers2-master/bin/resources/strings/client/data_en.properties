# - data.properties has the english localizations
# - data_en.properties (this file) is empty, and exists to help the ResourceBundle loader
#   find data.properties instead of fallback to client OS's locale when that's es which we have a localization for
# - Useful when debugging/testing client localizations to other locales (run with -Djsettlers.locale=en_US)
# - See 2016-03-15 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36011759/resourcebundle-that-defaults-to-english
