  <H1>Settlers of Catan: Basic Rules</H1>
  <BR>
	<STRONG>Game Summary</STRONG><BR>
  <P>
	The object of the game is to be the first player to get 10 Victory Points (VP).  This is done by building roads, settlements, and cities.  You can also gain VP through buying Development Cards, building the longest road, or amassing the largest army.  In order to build something or buy a Dev. Card, you need to spend resources.  These resources are obtained from your settlements and cities as well as through trade with other players.<BR>
	<BR><BR>
  <STRONG>Beginning the Game</STRONG><BR>
	<P>
	The game starts by having each player place two settlements and a road connected to each settlement.  A randomly chosen player places one settlement and a connected road on the board.  Then the next player going clockwise does the same, until the fourth player is reached.  This player places two settlements and roads and then receives one resource for each hex that the second settlement touches.  Then the next player going counter-clockwise places a second settlement and road and receives resources in the same manner.  This continues until the first player places his or her pieces and receives resources.  After this, the first player takes his or her turn followed by the next player going clockwise and so on.<BR>

	<STRONG>Turn Summary</STRONG><BR>
	<OL>
	<LI>Roll the dice
	<LI>Receive resources
	<LI>Trade and/or build
	</OL>
	<P>On a player's turn, that player may play a Dev. Card before rolling the dice.  After rolling the dice, resources are distributed.  All players receive a resource if his or her settlement is touching a hex that is labeled with the number that the dice are showing.  The kind of resource is determined by the color of the hex.  Players who have cities touching the hex that matches the dice receive two resources instead of one.  

	<P>If a seven is rolled, no hexes produce resources and any players who have more than seven resources must discard half of their resources rounding down.  After this, the player who rolled the dice moves the robber and takes a resource at random from a player who has a settlement touching the hex that the robber is on.  As long as the robber is on that hex, it will not produce resources.

	<P>After receiving resources the player who rolled the dice may trade resources and build as much as they want until they are done.  A player may make any kind of trade with another player as long as the player who rolled the dice is involved and at least one resource is exchanged from each player.  The current player may also trade with the bank by giving four of one kind of resource in exchange for one of another.  If the current player has a settlement or city on a port, that player can trade for the indicated ratio.  A 3:1 port means that the player can give the bank three of one kind of resource for one of another.  A colored port means that the player can trade two of the indicated resource for one of another.

	<P>If the current player has the right kinds of resources, he or she can build.  The building area shows what combinations are necessary for each item.  If the button next to the item says "Buy", then it is available.  In addition to having the right resources, the player must also have that piece available to play and a legal spot on the board to place the piece.  

	<P>Settlements must be placed touching a road of the same color.  They must also not be adjacent to another settlement or city.  This means that the nearest settlement or city must be no closer than two roads away.

	<P>Roads must be placed touching a road, settlement, or city of the same color.

	<P>A city must be placed where a settlement of the same color already is on the board.  The settlement goes into the player's stock of usable pieces.

	<P>A player can buy and trade as much as they want, in any order, until they are done.<BR>
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Development Cards</STRONG><BR>
  <P>In addition to building, a player can buy Development Cards.  There are a number of different kinds of Dev. Cards.  Here is a breakdown of the different cards:<BR>
<BR>
14 Knights<BR>
 5 VP Cards<BR>
 2 Road Building<BR>
 2 Monopoly<BR>
 2 Discovery<BR>

  <P>Most Dev. Cards are Knights.  When a Knight is played, that player may move the robber and take a resource at random from a player touching the new robber hex.  In addition, the played Knight card is added to your army (see Largest Army below).
	
	<P>VP Cards are worth 1 VP each and aren't shown until the end of the game.  They represent developments of your colony and have names like University or Library.

	<P>Road Building allows you to place two roads on the board without paying resources for them.  You must still have two roads available and places to put them on the board.

	<P>Monopoly	allows you to take all of one kind of resource from the other players.

	<P>Discovery allows you to receive two resources of any kind.

	<P>You may only play one Dev. Card per turn, and you can't play a Dev. Card the same turn that you buy it.<BR>
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Longest Road</STRONG><BR>
  <P>The player with the longest road of at least five segments receives 2 VP.  Another player needs to surpass the current player with the longest road title in order to take it away.  If a road is interrupted by another player's settlement or city, that road is cut in two sections.  If this cutting results in a tie, neither player gets the longest road title.<BR>
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Largest Army</STRONG><BR>
  <P>A player who has the largest army of three or more knights receives 2 VP.  Another player needs to surpass the current player with the largest army title in order to take it away.
